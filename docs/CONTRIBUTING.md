# Contributing

## Development workflow

1) Create a feature branch.
2) Keep changes focused and well-scoped.
3) Update or add tests where behavior changes.
4) Run `pytest` for backend changes.
5) Run `npm run lint` or `npm run test` if you update frontend tooling.

## Coding standards

- Prefer small, composable functions.
- Keep API response shapes consistent.
- Avoid logging secrets or PII.

## Pull requests
